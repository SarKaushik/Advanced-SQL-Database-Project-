Advanced Database Application developed using MS Access for Consultants and Client databases, several common processes can be implemented to enhance functionality and efficiency.**



**Imported External Data To MS Excel:**

Imported external data from MS Excel files into MS access for analysis, manipulation, and presentation.


**Design a database form object:**


Utilized the MS Access form object feature to create customized forms within the database application. These forms were user interfaces for efficient data entry, display, and interaction with the underlying database tables.


**Performed SQL query execution to get desired results in MS Access**

Executed SQL queries in MS Access to obtain desired results. This involved crafting and running queries within the database, allowing me to retrieve specific data sets and achieve the intended outcomes.

Executed multiple queries based on the scenarios listed in the AdvancedDatabaseApplication design document.


**Report Generation**

Achieved successful report generation in MS Access by employing the Report Wizard functionality. This involved harnessing the Report Wizard's capabilities to create a diverse set of reports that provided insightful perspectives on both client and consultant data.



**Administrative Tasks**

Successfully conducted database administrative tasks in MS Access, including a thorough examination of current database properties, meticulous verification of the last update date, utilization of performance analysis tools to optimize relationships between database objects, and the implementation of effective backup strategies by creating backup copies of the database application. 



**BLOB and CLOB data types** 

BLOB (Binary Large Object) and CLOB (Character Large Object) are data types used in databases. BLOB stores binary data, such as images or multimedia files, while CLOB is designed for character data, like text documents. They enable efficient storage and retrieval of large volumes of data within a database, catering to different types of information – binary or character-based.

I have used BLOB and CLOB data types while creating database structures to store multi-media files, images, and large character data in Oracle SQL database. Developed analytical functions using SQL queries to generate real-time insights from the data.



**Video Rental Application**

Designed backend tables, formed table relationships, and crafted entity relationship diagrams for the Video Rental Application system. Implemented diverse analytical functions to extract valuable insights aligned with business requirements.

**Hotel Reservation System Solution**

Created a Hotel Management System server-side application with ASP.NET, PL/SQL, MS Access, and Oracle SQL. Developed multiple Web Forms tailored to business needs, facilitating information collection and CRUD operations on the Oracle SQL database to achieve business goals.


**Supply Chain Management Application**

This project revolves around a database scheme that concentrates on supply chain activities.    	A supply chain controls the flow of material, information, money and services from raw material suppliers through factories and warehouses to the end customer.

The typical chain has this sequential structure:

` `Supplier → Factory → Warehouse → Distribution → End Customer

` `As an example of a supply chain, consider a customer purchasing a cold breakfast cereal.  Here, the supplier could be the manufacturer of the product.  The product is produced in large quantities in a factory.  The factory bundles the breakfast cereals and sends them to a regional warehouse, which in turn ships the bundles to a district distribution center.  The distribution center then delivers the items to retail or grocery stores to make the product available for customer purchase.

I contributed to a supply chain database project focusing on the seamless coordination of material, information, money, and services from suppliers to end customers. The project mapped the sequential flow: Supplier → Factory → Warehouse → Distribution → End Customer. In this context, I designed the database and implemented PL/SQL triggers. These triggers serve various functions, including alerting suppliers about low inventory, notifying customers upon item shipment, and indicating if a specific product ID is unavailable.
